Hello! My name is Michal, after years of work in logistics, closely related to data analysis, I decided to focus on it more and use the experience i gained to pursue new challenges within that field. Up until now i have been working with data my entire professional career and learned to understand it and make unbiased decisions driven by it. I've always considered myself relatively tech savvy but in recent months, my computer-related interests have skyrocketed and I've started to explore a ton of new concepts and technologies and I've found passion in that which i aim to develop for the rest of my life. 

In this project, i have set out to analyze and visualize two publicly available datasets containing information about the Covid-19 pandemic:
- Covid_Deaths
- Covid_Vaccinations

After initial data cleaning i focused on creating SQL queries to explore the data. After that i decided that it would benefit from sourcing additional information on global GDP indicators so i wrote a **python** script that helped me retrieve that data from the **World Bank API**. Initially I've started working in **Supabase's postgreSQL** environment but, since I'm using **Linux** as my daily operating system, I've found it hard to connect to it to **PowerBI** since Supabase required a SSL connection and i had to run PowerBI via a **virtual machine**. I then extracted the data and moved onto a **railway-hosted** MySQL server which was much easier to integrate. In the course of exploring the data I've found some useful insights, some of which were:

- How the timelag in vaccination affected the global death rates,
- How less developed countries performed below expectations, possibly due to the supply chain constraints around the world,
- How globally sourced data oscillated on a weekly basis due to staff shortages and insufficient documentation.

Although I've worked with data my entire carrier, it was mainly on a smaller datasets, handlable with Excel but i have a strong understanding of basics of data-handling tools and i aim to continuously learn to be able to translate my mental data analysis skills into an efficient and innovative workflow.
